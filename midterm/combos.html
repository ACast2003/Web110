            <h2>Combo Theory</h2>
            <p>
                Modern Yu-gi-oh has become a fast paced game. The typical game of Yu-gi-oh will
                involve a coinflip, a first player comboing off of one card, and setting up
                "boss" Monsters with powerful negation, removal, or "floodgate" effects in order
                to prevent the opponent from being able to do the same but attack them first 
                as the player going second has the ability to attack first. Combos are then 
                the most basic mechanics by which the game turns you 5 card opening hand
                into a threat formidable enough to win. 
            </p>
            <h2>Documentation</h2>
            <p>
                Yu-gi-oh uses a variety of repeated game actions which I will be abbreviating 
                here for the sake of brevity.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>ns = normal summon</li>
                <li>ss = special summon</li>
                <li>eff = effect</li>
                <li>pop = destroy</li>
                <li>gy = graveyard</li>
                <li>bin = put in graveyard</li>
                <li>cc = Combined Creation</li>
            </ul>
