            <h2>Mementotlan Engine</h2>
            <img src="MementotlanCombinedCreation.webp" alt="Mementotlant Combined Creation Art from Konami">
            <p> The typical Mementotlan decklist consists of the following</p>
            <ul>
                <li>3 Mementotlan Angwitch</li>
                <li>2-3 Mementotlan Darkblade</li>
                <li>3 Mementotlan Tatsunootoshigo</li>
                <li>1 Mementotlan Combined Creation</li>
                <li>1 Mementotlan-Horned Dragon</li>
                <li>1 Mementotlan Mace</li>
                <li>1-2 Mementotlan Goblin</li>
                <li>1 Mementotlan Ghattic</li>
                <li>1 Mementotlan Shleepy</li>
                <li>1 Mementotlan Akihiron</li>
                <li>2 Mementomictlan Tecuhtlica - Creation King [extra deck]</li>
                <li>1 Mementotlan Twin Dragon [extra deck]</li>
                <li>3 Mementotlan Fusion</li>
                <li>3 Mementotlan Bone Party</li>
                <li>1 Mementomictlan</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This in total accounts for ~23 of your minimum 40 main deck slots leaving
                17 slots for non-engine and only 3 of your maximum 15 extra deck slots.
            </p>
            <h2>Non Engine Staples</h2>
            <p> 
                The amount of non Engine "staple" cards you want to play depends on
                a few factors such as; how much more than 40 cards you want to play,
                the size of your secondary engine (if any), and the going second vs going first
                split you want to make. That being said there are some staples you are going
                to want to play regardless the top three being. 
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>2 Maxx "C"</li>
                <li>3 Ash Blossom &amp; Joyous Spring</li>
                <li>2 Called By The Grave</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Maxx "C" is the current strongest card in the Master Duels format so 
                playing the maxximum (2) copies of it and 5 cards that can stop a Maxx "C"
                or otherwise interrupt your opponent is a wise choice.
            </p>
            <h2>Side Engines</h2>
            <p> 
                While it is possible to play pure Mementotlan, most decks opt to play a
                secondary package of cards to supplement the main engine and make the most
                of the extra deck. I will detail some of the most popular side engines bellow
            </p>
            <h3>Fiendsmith Engine</h3>
            <p>
                Fiendsmith is a popular engine in almost every deck that doesn't lock itself
                and for good reason. The fiendsmith package requires only 5 main deck slots
                and 5-7 extra deck slots. It is able to turn 2 pieces of extra materials (or excess
                monsters) into an untargetable boss monster that negates and outs. Its flexible, 
                able to play through most interruptions, it recycles its self if the game goes long
                and can work as a backup plan in case your main engine gets stopped before 
                it can get filling the graveyard. The biggest weakness of fiendsmith are 
                that it adds 2 bricks (or cards you dont want in your oppening hand) to the Deck
                and the presence of common antifiendsmith tech cards in the metagame
                due to its previlance and power.
            </p>
            <h3>Super polymerization</h3>
            <p>
                While not an engine per say, Super polymerization takes up a large enough
                Amount of extra deck slots that it can be classified as one, 3 copies of
                super polymerization main deck and 3-5 targets in the extra deck. Super 
                polymerization is a board breaker allowing you to get around untargetable
                boss monsters while going second, and going first, is not unusable as you.
                can use it to fusion summon your extenders. My choice of side engine. Its 
                main weakness is the large amount of extra deck space it takes essentially
                religating it to being the only side engine.
            </p>
            <h3>Berfomet</h3>
            <p>
                A powerful but difficult to play engine, using only 1 main deck slot and
                4 extra deck slots this play lets you turn 3 materials into an S;P Little 
                Knight and a Diabellze the Original Sinkeeper. Half of this package fits
                into the fiendsmith package perfectly, allowing for easy synergy there 
                but it also can be played alone, by getting out Diabellze you can use the 
                many destruction effects of Mementotlan to essentially negate spells, 
                covering a major weakness of Mementotlan. This combo is difficult to pull 
                off in a timely manner and requires a ton of attention and rules knowledge
                but is arguable the strongest way to play fiendsmith.
            </p>
