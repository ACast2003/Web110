            <h2>What is Mementotlan? And furthermore what is Yu-Gi-Oh?</h2>
            <p>
                Mementotlan is the archetype I play in my current favorite collectable card
                game, Yu-gi-oh. Yu-gi-oh is a card game in which you play against an opponent
                and attempt to reduce their life points to zero before they can do the same
                to you. Modern Yu-gi-oh has evolved past its roots of summoning big monsters
                and crushing your opponent with them into a complex series of combos, interaction
                archetypes, and matchups. Unlike other card games, Yu-gi-oh lacks a traditional
                resource mechanic so to keep decks different i.e. not just all the best cards
                Konami, the company behind Yu-gi-oh, uses archetypes or a large series of cards
                that refer to each other or otherwise have synergies with each other to
                keep decks different.

            <h2>Mementotlan Design</h2>
            <p>
                The Mementotlan monsters all pay homage to classic Yu-gi-oh Normal monsters
                from the days of old, but now retrained and given powerful effects. 
                The name, Mementotlan, pays homage to that fact with Mementos refrering to
                reminders of the departed. The -tlan suffix inturn refers to the Aztec underworld
                Mictlan further being reinforced by the archetype's field spell being called
                "Mementomictlan".

            <h2>So what makes Mementotlan a Unique Deck?</h2>
            <p>
                The Mementotlan cards were first released in 2023's Valiant Smasher expansion
                and are a series of monsters that have interactions with the graveyard. 
                Their main game plan is to fill the graveyard with differently named Mementotlan
                monsters in order to summon their boss monster, Mementotlan Combined Creation
                a massive monster with 5000 attack and defense points. From there the deck
                has cards that allow you to protect it and disrupt the opponent until you have
                the opportunity to attack you opponent for massive damage. To get there 
                Mementotlan uses fusion monsters, and a series of main deck effect monsters
                allowing for multiple paths to victory to account for variance in your 
                starting hand, as well as interruptions from your opponent.
