          <h3>Maliss</h3>
          <p>
            Malis is a flexible combo deck that utilizes cyberse link monsters
            and the banishment zone to create value out of link decoder and set
            up a powerful endboard with traps, recursion, and powerful link
            monsters. Maliss's playstyle of banishing their own cards for value
            makes it very hard to disrupt as there are not many ways to interact
            with banished cards. Maliss' primary weakness is to "lingering" hand
            traps or handtraps that apply an effect that lasts the whole turn.
            Artifact Lancea is a hand trap that disables the ability to banish
            cards for a turn. This can totally shut down Maliss's combo lines.
            Droll and Lock bird is another good lingering hand trap not quite as
            much of a hose against Maliss as they can play though it with a good
            enough opening hand it doubles as an anti Maxx "C" tech on your own
            turn as you are able to combo through it. Other than that there are
            few ways to beat maliss going second it is the undisputed best deck
            right now for a reason.

          <h3>Blue Eye</h3>
          <p>
            Blue Eyes White Dragon is midrange combo deck capible of setting up
            powerful end boards thanks to their link one monster and sustaining
            a long game thanks to the primite engine. Blue eyes monsters are
            very hard to out if they stick. Blue eyes however has two key cards
            that are part of all of their combos that can be hit with common
            hand traps to keep them off getting two spirit dragons on the field.
            The first is the aformentioned link one "Spirit With Eyes of Blue",
            this monster is how they begin most combos and is vulnerable to
            "Infinite Impermanence" and effect veiler both common handtraps that
            negate a monsters effect. Blue eyes lacks a way to tag it out to
            dodge the removal as the tribute is not on a quick effect. The
            second big hit is to save ash blossom for "Wishes with Eyes of Blue"
            a powerful spell that adds both a spell and a light tuner to hand
            but costs a discard to activate, this means negating it is a two for
            one denying them lots of resources.

        <h3>Fiendsmith Control</h3>
        <p>
          Fiendsmith control takes the already powerful recursive engine of
          fiendsmith and super charges it by playing it alongside a prismite
          package for dipity a, level 4 light fiend normal monster, and the
          bystials, a collection of maindeck handtrap dragons that stop
          graveyard decks that use light and dark monsters. This deck will never
          run out of resources so defeating it quickly is a must, Luckily
          mementotlan is good at one turn killing. The decks biggest weak points
          in their combo are standard fiendsmith targets, ash blossom on the
          link one and imperm on the link 2. This deck isnt as big of a threat
          to mementotlan however its prevalence means you should be prepared for
          it.
